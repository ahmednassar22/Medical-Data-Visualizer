# Medical-Data-Visualizer
The rows in the dataset represent patients and the columns represent information like body measurements, results from various blood tests, and lifestyle choices. You will use the dataset to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.

Create a chart similar to examples/Figure_1.png, where we show the counts of good and bad outcomes for the cholesterol, gluc, alco, active, and smoke variables for patients with cardio=1 and cardio=0 in different panels.

Use the data to complete the following tasks in medical_data_visualizer.py:
